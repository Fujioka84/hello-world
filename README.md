# hello-world
This is part of my journey to become a programmer.

I'm currently working in a sales position. And I'm miserable. Programming was something I hadn't seriously considered until a couple of months ago. I've always viewed it as a field reserved for the intellectually gifted - unattainable for someone like me who didn't have the dedication and discipline needed to graduate from college.

But I have decided to test that notion and dove head first into learning how to program.
 
Wish me luck.
